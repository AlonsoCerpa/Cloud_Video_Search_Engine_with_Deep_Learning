Cloud-Based Video Search Engine with Deep Learning

A video search pipeline has been designed and implemented, the search engine uses the tags of the videos to do the search.
The tags are found using a pre-trained neural network model of object detection allocated in the cloud.
The system allows you to upload new videos, which are soon available in the search engine.

This is the architecture of the cloud-based search engine with Deep Learning:

And this is a capture of the web interface of the search engine:
